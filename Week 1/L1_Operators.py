1 + 2 # Math between integers = integer answer except division which is always a float
2 - 1
2 * 2
4 / 2
1.2 - 1 # If there is a float in the calculation, the answer will equal a float
5 // 2 # Floor divide (Rounds down). Since there are 2 integers, the quotient will also be an integer
5 % 2 # Modulus Operator: Returns the remainder of the division
 # # E.g. 5 % 2: 5 // 2 = 2
  # # # 2 * 2 = 4: There is a remainder of 1 to get to five, so the answer will be 1
5 ** 2 # Exponents 
5 + 6/2 - 5 + (6/2) - 5 + 3 # Use brackets
